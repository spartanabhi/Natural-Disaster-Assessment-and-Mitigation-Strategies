# **Natural Disaster Prediction and Mitigation Strategies**  

## **Overview**  
This project leverages machine learning and real-time weather data integration to predict flood risks and provide actionable mitigation strategies. Designed for real-world applications, it enhances disaster preparedness, reduces economic losses, and empowers communities through data-driven solutions.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Accurate Flood Predictions:** Uses RandomForestClassifier to achieve 80-90% prediction accuracy.  
- **Weather Forecasting:** Forecasts temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall using regressor models.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Flask-based web application for input and result visualization.  
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Combines historical weather datasets with live updates from the OpenWeather API.  
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Provides structural, non-structural, and socio-economic solutions.  

---

## **System Architecture**  
![Architecture Diagram](link-to-diagram)  
- **Input:** City name, real-time weather data, historical datasets.  
- **Process:** Data preprocessing → ML model predictions → Results processing.  
- **Output:** Flood risk level and actionable insights.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python (Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas).  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
- **APIs:** OpenWeather API for real-time weather data.  
- **ML Models:** RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressors.
